                        <br>
                        A Visionary Beginning: It all started in 1946 when Pietro Ferrero, a visionary confectioner from Italy, set out to create something extraordinary. With a humble beginning in the town of Alba, he dreamed of crafting confections that would bring joy to people's lives.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Birth of Nutella: In 1964, Pietro's son, Michele Ferrero, introduced the world to Nutella, a delicious hazelnut spread that would revolutionize breakfast tables everywhere. Combining hazelnuts, cocoa, and a touch of magic, Nutella quickly became an icon of taste and happiness.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Innovating with Rocher: Building on the success of Nutella, Ferrero continued to innovate. In 1982, Ferrero Rocher was introduced, offering a luxurious combination of creamy chocolate, crispy wafer, and roasted hazelnuts. It soon became synonymous with elegance and indulgence.
                        <br>
                        <br>
